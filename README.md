This repository contains the challenges for the Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning course.

## Challenge 1 - Image Classification of Plants ðŸŒ´ðŸª´ðŸŒ±

In this homework we were required to classify species of plants 
(like the ones in the example image below), which are divided into 
categories according to the species of the plant to which they belong. 
Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict 
the correct class label.
